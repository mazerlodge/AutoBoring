Ch02 Practice Questions
1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
	True and False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
	and, or, not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
	> and 
		T 	F 
	T   T   F 
	F   F   F 

	> or
		T 	F 
	T   T   T 
	F   T   F 

	> not 
	negates the value; so "not T" = False and "not F" = True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
	False and False = False 
not (5 > 4)
	not True = False 
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
	True or False = True 
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
	not ((True) or (False)) = False 
(True and True) and (True == False)
	(True) and (False) = False 
(not False) or (not True)
	True or False = True 

5. What are the six comparison operators?
	==, <, > 
	<=, >=, != 

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
	Equal to (==) does a comparision, the assignment op (=) always assigns a val to the left operand 
7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
	a statement such as (x<4), used in conditional statements (e.g. if and while statements) to determine if a block of code executes
	Used to manage looping  

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
	Identified by indentation level 
	Block #1, Top level, always executes 
	Block 2 only exec if spam equals 10 
	Block 3a execs if spam > 5 OR Block 3b execs if spam <= 5

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, 
	and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
	if spam==1:
		print("Hello")
	elif spam == 2: 
		print("Howdy")  
	else: 
		print("Greetings!")

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
	Ctl-C 

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
	break exits execution of a loop regarless if the termination criteria has been met 
	continue stops the current iteration of a loop by continues processing subseq interations

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
	nothing 

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
	Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
	for x in range(1,11):
		print(x)

	x=1
	while (x<11):
		print(x) 
		x = x + 1


14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
	spam.bacon()

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the internet, and find out what they do. 
	Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
	Done
