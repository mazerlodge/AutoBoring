Extra credit: Search online for the Python documentation for the len() function. It will be on a web page titled “Built-in Functions.” Skim the list of other functions Python has, look up what the round() function does, and experiment with it in the interactive shell.
	>>> round(42)
	42
	>>> round(42.2)
	42
	>>> round(42.9)
	43
	>>> round(42.5)
	42
	>>> round(42.51)
	43
	>>> round(42.5000001)
	43
